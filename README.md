# WNYPlantConservation
WNY Plant Conservation data base combining citizen science initiatives and AI to help conserve and educate the public around local medicinal plants.

This project will combine visual data via LLM API for plant identification and geolocation data to further plant conservation efforts locally in Western New York, the project hopes to collaberate with local univerrsities, nature preserves, and botanical gardens to further the data collection and database efforts. 

#Initial Data base 

The intial database will include the most comprehensive botanical survey possible over a year period 2024 Jan - 2025 Jan
Large citizen science surveys will be conducted and all possible plants of medicinal value will be documented over the scope of Niagara and Erie County. 
Plants will be sorted by rarity according to global and local standards based on available data

#AI Visual ID App
Building on previous plant ID apps, the visual AI ID App will allow students, researchers and citizen scientists to document, analyze and identify various medicinal plants in the WNY area

#AI will include
1. Two day information stream and UI via large language model interface.
   - Prompted questions by AI for easy user engagement (location, season, time of day, etc) to gather various meta data for the data base
  data is then sent to the data base, and the data base returns back via LLM key information around the plant in question (how rare it is, "This plant is rare and endangered, do not pick, and if possible gather or spread seeds", medicinal uses, traditional native uses and lore, etc.
